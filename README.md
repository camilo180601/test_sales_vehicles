# test_sales_vehicles
Technical vehicle sales test is developed, using SQL, JavaScript, PHP, jQuery, Bootstrap, HTML5 and CSS3

The installation is first of all in the SQL server, in this case xampp is used to turn it on open the page http://localhost/phpmyadmin/index.php in the SQL console to enter the SQL code in the file database/ventas_de_vehiculos.sql in this way to create the database

Then create a copy of the repository or clone it and paste it into the C:\xampp\htdocs folder, which is where xampp is installed and turn on the Apache and MySql server, in order to run the web.

In index.php we can find the selection of the make and model of the vehicle through a form action to index2.php which sends us to a form that takes data on the number of vehicles to buy, then we register the sale with a button and gives us the option to see sales on a page through a table, where we display the details of each sale.
